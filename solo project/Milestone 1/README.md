## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{We have found a collection of datasets that provide historical information on the cryptocurrency Bitcoin from the years 2013 to 2018.

We're intending to use this data to analyze the changes in price / volatility of Bitcoin over this time period in order to better understand and predict how it will act in the future.}

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{We found our dataset on Kaggle.com, and is a portion of a collection of data called "Cryptocurrency Historical Prices" created by SRK.

The main dateset we are using is called "bitcoin_dataset" and it is comprised of 2920 rows and 24 columns, where the rows represent a specific point in time, and the columns represent various financial information about Bitcoin, including total price, market cap, and cost per transaction, amoung others.

The purpose of the dataset is to help individuals understand the historical data of Bitcoin in order to help them predict the its future prices. We intend on using the data for the same reason, in order to better understand the specific changes that happened to this currency over this period.

It is made up of primnarily quantitative data, which should make it easy for us to draw some conslusions and create beautiful visualizations and dashboards.}
