Task 4: Conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on your dataset (30%)¶
If you are working in groups, each person should do their EDA separately and independently. You have chosen rich datasets and there should be plenty of different features for each of you to explore.

Note: The EDA task (Task 4) is different from the Analysis task (Task 5). The EDA is “exploratory” in nature, and is done at a superficial level to get counts of columns, limits, ranges, understand the data distribution, and a cursory look at the relationships between the columns. Think of it as a ‘quick and dirty’ analysis of your data in preparation for a more thorough analysis.

You should use the project_functions to store any functions (including method chains) rather than defining them in your notebook.

As a rough guideline, each EDA should:

Involve at least two columns/features of your dataset

At least three useful visualizations created by you (the more the merrier (within reason)!)

Some notes and commentary to help others see observations you find interesting.

Remember that the goal of the EDA is to understand and explore your datasets. Here are three examples or guides:

Guide 1

Guide 2

Guide 3

Lab 4 had some elements of a rudimentary EDA (but we expect much more from you now!)
