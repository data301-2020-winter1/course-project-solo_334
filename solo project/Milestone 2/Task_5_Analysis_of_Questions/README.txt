Task 5. Conduct your analysis to help answer your research question(s) (40%)¶
Armed with your EDA, you should now be ready to conduct a thorough analysis to answer your research question(s). This section can be completed together as a group (and only one file should be submitted) but you may (and are encouraged) to try this yourself first, and then combine them together in one submission.

Each group will have a different data analysis product, however some guidelines to keep you on the right track:

You should remain focused on your research question(s) - it is very easy to get lost down rabbit holes in data analyses projects.

If you find that your research questions are not that interesting, or you find more interesting questions (especially after your EDA) you may revise them, or add more.

Use the lab times, as well as our office hours (TAs and instructors), to get help and guidance on your analyses.

You should experiment with “plenty of” data visualizations to try and visualize your dataset and answer your research questions.

Give us a narrative/story of your explorations as you go along, in-line with your data - use the new Markdown skills you learned in Task 1!
