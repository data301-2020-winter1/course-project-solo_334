Task 2: Introduction to Git merges, branches, and more (0%)¶
After many years of searching, I have found the PERFECT tutorial to help you get more familiar with git commands, particularly branching, and merging - things you will start encountering when you start collaboratively working on the projects. Rather than make this a milestone task though, I will be including it as Lab 5. It’s included here so you know that you should do this part of the lab before proceeding to Task 3 onwards. You are responsible for completing the following modules (at minimium):

“Main: Introduction Sequence” <- This should mostly be review

Exercise 1

Exercise 2

Exercise 3

Exercise 4

“Remote: Push & Pull – Git Remotes”

Exercise 1

Exercise 2

Exercise 3

Exercise 4

Exercise 5

Exercise 6

Exercise 7

Exercise 8
